##### Note:

- [Fresh Installation](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisiem/7.1.6/esx-installation-guide/131018/fresh-installation)

##### Steps:

- download the ova (e.g., FortiSIEM-VA-7.1.6.1663.ova) and open in VMWare workstation
- normal settings
	- OS - 25GB
	- OPT - 100GB
	- CMDB - 60GB
	- SVN - 60GB
	- Local database - depending on required retention period
		- `Local database = (RF X EPS X Event Size X Online Retention X 24 X 60 X 60)/(Compression Ration X 1024 X 1024 X 1024)`
			- RF - Retention Factor

- FortiSIEM will use `Rocky Linux`
	- localhost login - root
	- password - ProspectHills

- go to `configFSM.sh` script and run it
```bash
find / -name "configFSM.sh"
```

- we get 4 options to configure (`FortiSIEM Manger` is optional, its for huge setup)
- just select `Supervisor` its an all-in-one solution > `install_without_fips`
- setup the IPv4 address, Gateway and DNS1 and DNS2
- configure the hostname (i.e., `FQDN`)
- for checking network connectivity, enter the host (default:- google.com)
- run configuration command (i.e., python script)

- after installation, login
- ping the gateway to check the connectivity
- ping google to check the internet connectivity

- to activate the license visit the FortiCloud(`support.fortinent.com`) and enter product serial number. (basically you will get email from the fortinet)
	- choose non-government user
- if you already registered, got to FortiCloud > Product > Product List, then change the hardware id (you can find harware ID in FortiSIEM). Then download the new license. then upload it in FortiSIEM (e.g., https://IP/phoenix/licenseUpload.html)
- Choose Enterprise as license type if you are not using multi tenant.
- now you can login

- during installation, you need to choose DB, choose `clickhouse` (best option), `storage tier` can be 1 (if replication factor is 1), then you need to mount the hard disk
	- for this create a new host in `PuTTY Configuration`. give host name (or IP address), port and save session then save and open. then login as `root`
		- to get the list of all the partition: `lsblk` - note down the `sde`
	- Disk path should be: `/dev/sde` and then press `test` then you will be redirected to page 2 and here you need to provide the admin password.
- next login and access the UI
- to verify the services, we should see all the services up and running in `PuTTY`, use `phstatus` command

*Note:*
- PuTTY isÂ **a free terminal emulator Windows users can use to connect to a website via SSH**. This allows you to run UNIX commands on your server, which is not available when connecting using an FTP client.
